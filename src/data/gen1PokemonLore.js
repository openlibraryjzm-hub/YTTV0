    39: "Jigglypuff's voice can lull almost any listener to sleep. It sings with such purity that travellers and Pokémon alike often doze off mid-song—which only makes this round, balloon-like creature cross. It has a habit of leaning in and marking the faces of those who fell asleep with a marker, as if to say you missed the encore. Despite that temper, many in Kanto keep a Jigglypuff as a living lullaby. To befriend one is to walk the line between gentle lullaby and indignant performer.",
    46: "Paras carries a pair of mushrooms on its back from birth. Those mushrooms are parasitic: they draw nutrients from the host, and as Paras grows they grow with it, eventually taking over much of its body by the time it becomes Parasect. In the wild, Paras scrapes tree roots and damp soil for food that feeds both itself and its fungal riders. Forest lore in Kanto often treats Paras as a warning—a creature that is never quite alone in its own skin. To catch a Paras is to hold a life forever shared with the fungus that feeds on it.",
    143: "Snorlax spends most of its life asleep. It eats in huge bursts, then sleeps for days or weeks, often in the middle of a path or a valley so that nothing can get by until it wakes. When it does wake, it is usually gentle unless provoked; the real challenge is moving it at all. Villagers in Kanto tell stories of roads and rivers blocked by a single sleeping Snorlax, and of the rare trainer who earns one and gains a friend that doubles as a living wall. To meet a Snorlax is to meet a mountain that dreams.",
    150: "Mewtwo was created in a lab—a clone of the mythical Mew, altered for raw power. It was never given a choice in its own making, and that rage and grief shaped it into one of the most dangerous Pokémon in the world. Its psychic strength is legendary; it can level buildings and bend minds. Yet beneath the fury is a being that never asked to exist. To face Mewtwo is to face the cost of playing creator: a life built for battle, with no one left to answer for the loneliness."
