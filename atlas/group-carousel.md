# Group Carousel System (Playlists Page)

The group carousel system lets users organize playlists into **colored-folder carousels** on the Playlists page. Each carousel is bound to one of **16 folder colors** (`FOLDER_COLORS`); at most one group exists per color. Carousels are stored in local state (Zustand + localStorage); no database tables are used. The **PlaylistBar** (sticky toolbar in the page content) provides a **folder prism** to switch between All grid, Unsorted grid, or a single carousel by color. The Playlists **view switcher and actions** (tabs, Info/Folder/Add) live in **TopNavigation** when the Playlists page is active.

**Related:** The **group badge** on the Player Controller’s Top Playlist Menu and **restriction of playlist navigation** (up/down) to the current group are documented in **`group-badge-player-controller.md`**. The **PlaylistBar** (prism, Add, Back/Close) is documented in **`playlist-bar.md`**.

## 1. User-facing behavior

### 1.1 Playlists page views (TabBar)

The Playlists page has three view modes:

| View    | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **ALL** | Shows all playlists in a 2-column grid. No carousels. |
| **UNSORTED** | Shows only playlists that are not in any group carousel. No carousels. |
| **GROUPS** | Shows only group carousels: one horizontal carousel per group, with a “New carousel” button at the bottom. No main grid. |

- **ALL** and **UNSORTED** use the same card size and grid layout (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-10`).
- **GROUPS** shows each group in a **bounded carousel box** (see below). Each carousel has its **own display mode** (Large / Small / Bar), set via mode buttons on that carousel's top bar; modes can be mixed. TopNavigation provides a one-shot **"apply to all"** (see 1.2). **Small and Large** carousels use a **white box** (`bg-white`), light gray border (`border-slate-200`), and **light top bar** (`bg-slate-50`, dark text); **Bar** mode keeps the dark box and bar.
  - **Large:** Cards use a larger fixed size (`min-w-[380px]`, `w-[min(520px,calc(50vw-2rem))]`), horizontal scroll via **bottom scrollbar only** (no side arrow buttons). Full PlaylistCard including 4 mini preview thumbnails. Cards inside the carousel have **no border** and **white background** (`PlaylistCard` receives `inCarousel: true`). Top bar: standard padding (`px-4 py-2.5`).
  - **Small:** Thumbnail-sized cards (~3 visible); PlaylistCard gets `size="small"` and `inCarousel: true` (injected by carousel) and uses a **minimal layout**: main-slot thumbnail on top, playlist title below (VideoCard-style). No title bar above the thumbnail; no 4 mini preview strip; no folder/count/set-as-cover overlays on the thumbnail (3-dot menu remains). Card wrapper `min-w-[140px]`, `w-[min(180px,calc(33vw-1rem))]`; gap `gap-4`; scroll via **bottom scrollbar only**; compact top bar (`px-3 py-1`); box `mb-1.5`, white background.
  - **Bar:** Thin bar only: Layers icon, title, inline scroll left/right, rename, delete. No thumbnails; hidden scroll strip keeps scroll position. Box `mb-3`, dark styling, compact bar.

### 1.2 Playlists bar (TopNavigation) and PlaylistBar (page content)

**TopNavigation** (mini header): When the current page is **Playlists**, it shows:

- **Apply to all (GROUPS only):** Three buttons left and above the title: Large, Small, Bar. **One-shot commands** – each click sets every carousel's mode via `playlistGroupStore.setAllGroupCarouselModes(mode)`.
- **Title:** “Playlists”.
- **Tabs:** `TabBar` (ALL | UNSORTED | GROUPS).
- **Actions:** Info (show/hide video titles on cards), Folder (show/hide colored folders), Add (open playlist uploader).
- **Navigation:** Back (when applicable), Close (full screen / close menu).

**PlaylistBar** (sticky toolbar in the **page content**, not the header): Rendered at the top of the Playlists page body. It includes VideoSortFilters, Add/Refresh/Bulk tag buttons, the **folder prism**, and Back/Close. The prism has segments for **All**, **Unsorted** (if any playlists are in no group), and **each folder color that has a group carousel**. Clicking a color segment sets the selected folder; when a color is selected, PlaylistsPage shows only that group’s carousel (single large carousel). See **`playlist-bar.md`** for props (`groupColorIds`, `selectedFolder`, `onFolderSelect`) and populated-only vs all-segments prism modes.

### 1.3 Creating and managing carousels

- **Colored folder model:** There are **16 folder colors** (see `src/utils/folderColors.js`: red, orange, amber, yellow, lime, green, emerald, teal, cyan, sky, blue, indigo, violet, purple, fuchsia, pink). Each **group** has a `folderColorId`; at most **one group per color**. The prism in PlaylistBar shows only colors that have a group (in populated-only mode).
- **New carousel (GROUPS view):** “New carousel” button below the last carousel uses `getNextAvailableColorId()` to pick the first unused color, then creates a group with `addGroup(color.name, nextColorId)`. If all 16 colors are used, an alert is shown and no group is created. Empty carousels still appear as a bounded box with a placeholder (“No playlists in this carousel”).
- **Per-carousel mode:** Each carousel's **top bar** has three mode buttons (Large / Small / Bar). The active mode is highlighted; clicking sets that carousel's mode only (`playlistGroupStore.groupCarouselModes[groupId]`). New groups default to Large.
- **Rename:** In the carousel **top bar**, a pencil icon opens a rename prompt. Only available when the carousel is rendered with `groupId` and `onRename` (i.e. on GROUPS).
- **Delete:** A trash icon in the top bar opens a confirmation: “Delete carousel “[name]”? Playlists will be unassigned from this carousel but not removed from the app.” Confirming removes the group and unassigns all playlists from it; playlists themselves are not deleted.

### 1.4 Assigning playlists to carousels

- **Assign to colored folder (playlist card 3-dot menu):** Opens the **PlaylistGroupColumn** overlay (full-screen, scrollable). The column shows **16 slots in `FOLDER_COLORS` order**. For each color: if a group exists for that color, a **colored group card** is shown (name, thumbnail from first playlist, “In carousel” when the current playlist is in that group); clicking toggles the playlist in/out of that group. If **no group** exists for that color, a **colored placeholder** is shown (“Create [Color] carousel”); clicking creates a new group for that color and adds the current playlist to it. Header text: “Assign to colored folder.”
- **Remove from carousel (playlist card 3-dot menu):** Shown only when the playlist is in at least one carousel. Label is “Remove from carousel” (one) or “Remove from carousels” (multiple). Removes the playlist from every carousel it’s in; playlists are not deleted.

## 3. Data model and state

### 3.1 playlistGroupStore

- **Storage:** Zustand with `persist` middleware; key `playlist-group-storage` in localStorage.
- **State:** `groups: Array<{ id: string, name: string, playlistIds: number[], folderColorId: string | null }>` (each group is bound to one of the 16 folder colors), `groupCarouselModes: { [groupId]: 'large' | 'small' | 'bar' }` (defaults to `'large'` when missing), `activeGroupId: string | null`.
- **Actions:**
  - `getGroupByColorId(colorId)` – returns the group that has `folderColorId === colorId`, or `null`.
  - `addGroup(name, folderColorId)` – creates a new group for the given folder color; returns the new group `id`. Name defaults to the color’s display name from `FOLDER_COLORS` if not provided.
  - `getNextAvailableColorId()` – returns the first `FOLDER_COLORS` id that does not yet have a group (for “New carousel”); returns `null` if all 16 are used.
  - `removeGroup(groupId)` – removes the group (playlists are unassigned, not deleted); clears `activeGroupId` if it was this group.
  - `setGroupCarouselMode(groupId, mode)` – sets this group’s carousel display mode (`'large' | 'small' | 'bar'`). Used by each carousel’s top-bar mode buttons.
  - `setAllGroupCarouselModes(mode)` – one-shot: sets every group’s carousel mode to `mode`. Used by TopNavigation “apply to all” buttons.
  - `addPlaylistToGroup(groupId, playlistId)` – adds a playlist to a group (idempotent).
  - `removePlaylistFromGroup(groupId, playlistId)` – removes a playlist from a group.
  - `isPlaylistInGroup(playlistId, groupId)` – returns whether the playlist is in that group.
  - `getGroupIdsForPlaylist(playlistId)` – returns array of group IDs that contain the playlist.
  - `renameGroup(groupId, name)` – renames the group.
  - `setActiveGroupId(id)` – sets or clears the "entered from" group (used by Player Controller badge and playlist navigation range). Set when user opens a playlist from a carousel card; cleared when opening from the main grid.
- **Migration:** Legacy single-list format (`groupPlaylistIds`) is migrated to one group named "Featured playlists" with a default color. Version 2 adds `activeGroupId` (default `null`). Version 3 adds `groupCarouselModes` (default `{}`). Version 4 adds `folderColorId` to each group (existing groups get color by index in `FOLDER_COLORS`).

### 3.2 tabStore (view mode)

- **Valid view IDs:** `'all' | 'unsorted' | 'groups'`.
- **activeTabId** is persisted; only these three values are accepted (others normalize to `'all'`).

### 3.3 layoutStore (Playlists header actions)

- **playlistsPageShowTitles** (boolean): Toggles “show video titles on all playlist cards.” Synced from localStorage on PlaylistsPage mount; persisted to localStorage when changed. Toggled from TopNavigation when on Playlists page.
- **setPlaylistsPageShowTitles(v?)**: Sets or toggles the above.
- **showPlaylistUploader** (boolean): When set to `true`, PlaylistsPage opens the playlist uploader and then clears this flag. Used by the “Add” button in TopNavigation when on Playlists page.
- **setShowPlaylistUploader(v)**: Sets the flag (e.g. `true` to open uploader).

---

## 4. Logic and UI flow

### 4.1 TopNavigation (Playlists bar)

- When `currentPage === 'playlists'` and `activeTabId === 'groups'` (from `useTabStore()`), the left side shows three “apply to all” buttons (Large / Small / Bar) above the title; each calls `setAllGroupCarouselModes(mode)` so every carousel’s stored mode is updated in one shot. No persistent override.
- When `currentPage === 'playlists'`, the right side of the header shows: TabBar, Info button (toggles `playlistsPageShowTitles`), Folder button (toggles `showColoredFolders` from folderStore), Add button (calls `setShowPlaylistUploader(true)`), then Back (if history/preview) and Close. The left side shows the title “Playlists.”

### 4.2 PlaylistsPage

- **PlaylistBar:** Renders `PlaylistBar` at the top of the content with `groupColorIds={playlistGroups.map(g => g.folderColorId).filter(Boolean)}`, `allPlaylistCount`, `unsortedCount`, `selectedFolder={selectedPrismFolder}`, `onFolderSelect={setSelectedPrismFolder}`, `onAddClick` (opens uploader). When user selects a prism segment, `selectedPrismFolder` is set to `null` (All), `'unsorted'`, or a color id; this drives whether the page shows the full grid, unsorted grid, or a single carousel (see below).
- **GROUPS view:** Renders one `GroupPlaylistCarousel` per group (including empty ones). Each carousel receives `title={group.name}`, `groupId={group.id}`, `onRename={renameGroup}`, `onDelete={removeGroup}`. When **a single folder is selected via the prism** (`selectedPrismFolder` is a color id), the page shows only the carousel for that color: the group is resolved with `getGroupByColorId(selectedPrismFolder)` and a single carousel is rendered (large carousel layout). Otherwise (All or Unsorted selected), no carousels are shown in the main area—only the grid.
- **ALL / UNSORTED view:** Renders the main grid. Filter:
  - ALL: all playlists.
  - UNSORTED: `getGroupIdsForPlaylist(playlist.id).length === 0`.
- **Assign column:** When `assignToGroupPlaylistId` is set, renders `PlaylistGroupColumn` with that playlist, `playlists`, `playlistThumbnails`, and `onClose`. Column uses the store (`getGroupByColorId`, `addGroup(color.name, color.id)`, `addPlaylistToGroup`, `removePlaylistFromGroup`, `isPlaylistInGroup`) and shows 16 slots in `FOLDER_COLORS` order: existing groups as colored cards, or placeholders that create a new group for that color on click.
- **Uploader:** When `showPlaylistUploader` from layoutStore is true, a `useEffect` opens the uploader (sets local `showUploader(true)`) and then calls `setShowPlaylistUploader(false)`.

### 4.3 GroupPlaylistCarousel

- **Structure:** Each carousel is a single **bounded box**. For **Small and Large** mode: white background (`bg-white`), light border (`border-slate-200`), rounded corners (`rounded-2xl`), shadow. For **Bar** mode: dark box (`bg-slate-800/40`, `border-white/10`, `rounded-xl`). No inner component is used (structure is inlined) so re-renders do not remount the scroll container and scroll position is preserved.
- **Mode:** Effective mode is read from `playlistGroupStore.groupCarouselModes[groupId]` (default `'large'`). No global override; TopNavigation “apply to all” updates every group’s stored mode.
- **Top bar:** A fixed top bar inside the box. For **Small/Large**: light bar (`bg-slate-50`, `border-b border-slate-200`), dark text (`text-slate-800`), sky icon; mode/rename/delete buttons use slate/sky hover. For **Bar**: dark bar (`bg-slate-800/60`, `border-white/10`) with inline scroll left/right. When `groupId` is set, **three mode buttons** (Large / Small / Bar) call `setGroupCarouselMode(groupId, mode)`; when `onRename`/`onDelete` are provided, rename (pencil) and delete (trash). In small/bar mode the bar is compact (`px-3 py-1` or `py-1.5`, smaller icons).
- **Empty group:** Same box and top bar; body shows a placeholder: “No playlists in this carousel” (omitted in bar mode). Empty state area uses `bg-slate-50` for Small/Large.
- **Bar mode (1+ items):** Only the top bar is visible; a hidden scroll strip keeps scroll position so the inline left/right buttons advance by one “slot” per click.
- **Large / Small mode (1+ items):** Horizontal scroll row:
  - Scrollable flex row with mode-dependent gap (`gap-10` large, `gap-4` small) and padding (`pt-3 pb-2` large, `pt-1 pb-1` small). Scrolling is **only via the horizontal scrollbar** at the bottom (no left/right arrow buttons on the sides).
  - Card wrapper: large `w-[min(520px,calc(50vw-2rem))] min-w-[380px]`; small `w-[min(180px,calc(33vw-1rem))] min-w-[140px]`. Children receive injected `size` and **`inCarousel: true`** via `React.cloneElement`. PlaylistCard with `inCarousel` has no card or thumbnail border and uses `bg-white` to match the carousel box.
  - No custom drag-to-scroll or scroll-snap; native horizontal scroll only. Stable keys on mapped children for list reconciliation.

### 4.4 PlaylistCard 3-dot menu

- **Assign to group** – calls `onAssignToGroupClick()`, which opens `PlaylistGroupColumn`.
- **Remove from carousel(s)** – only if `getGroupIdsForPlaylist(playlist.id).length > 0`; calls `removePlaylistFromGroup(gid, playlist.id)` for each such group.

---

## 5. Scrollbar styling

App-wide scrollbar styling is defined in `App.css` (universal `*::-webkit-scrollbar*` rules): 14px height/width, rectangular (no rounded ends), slate track/thumb with diagonal stripe pattern. **WebView (e.g. Tauri/WebView2) may not honor custom scrollbar appearance** (rounded or native look can still appear). Carousel horizontal scroll uses the same scrollbar; scrolling is only via the bottom scrollbar (no side arrow buttons).
