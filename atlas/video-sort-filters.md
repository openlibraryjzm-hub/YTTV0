# VideoSortFilters & Videos Page Sticky Toolbar

This document describes the **Videos page sticky toolbar**: the icon-based sort/rating bar (**VideoSortFilters**) and the **colored folder prism** that share one row. Together they provide sorting (default, date, progress, last viewed), rating filtering (drumstick 1–5), and folder filtering (All, Unsorted, 16 colors) with an optional “populated-only” prism mode.

---

## 1. Overview

**Location**: The sticky toolbar sits at the top of the Videos page content area (`VideosPage.jsx`). When the user scrolls down, the bar sticks to the top of the viewport (sticky positioning) and gains a stronger backdrop/blur for visibility.

**Layout (left to right)**:

1. **Sort & rating filters** – `VideoSortFilters.jsx`: two toolbar buttons (Home, Funnel). Funnel dropdown contains sort options and rating filter.
2. **Action buttons** – Add (uploader), Refresh (subscriptions; right-click = manage modal), Bulk tag (right-click = Auto-Tag). Same row, right of the filter; driven by `layoutStore`; VideosPage opens modals/refresh and clears one-shot flags.
3. **Folder prism** – Inline in `VideosPage.jsx`: a colored segment bar (All, Unsorted, 16 folder colors) that fills the remaining width. **Right-click** anywhere on the prism opens a context menu. This menu allows toggling between populated-only and all-segments mode, as well as an option to rename the specific colored folder (or the main playlist if clicking the All/Unsorted segments).
4. **Right side** – Back (when history or preview) and Close (fullscreen). These are the only Videos-page actions in the sticky bar on the right; **TopNavigation** no longer shows Add, Subscriptions, Bulk tag, Back, or Close when on Videos page (only the mini header title and the Twitter style toggle on the right remain there).

**State ownership**: Sort mode, sort direction, selected ratings, and prism mode are local state in `VideosPage.jsx`. Folder selection is in `folderStore`; folder counts and segment data are derived in `VideosPage` from `videoFolderAssignments` and `activePlaylistItems`.

## 2. VideoSortFilters Component

**File**: `src/components/VideoSortFilters.jsx`

Icon-based sort and rating filter bar. **Home** and **Funnel** use Lucide icons; the rating filter in the dropdown uses the drumstick emoji (🍗). Styling switches between **light** (All selected: white/light bar) and **dark** (Unsorted or a folder selected: colored bar) via the `isLight` prop.

### 2.1 The two toolbar buttons + dropdown contents

| Control   | Icon        | Behavior |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Home** | `Home`      | **Default order.** Sets sort to `shuffle`. No direction. Restores the default video order (shuffle-state driven). |
| **Funnel** | `Filter`  | **Sort & rating dropdown.** Click opens a dropdown with: (1) **Sort by date** (chronological), **Sort by progress** (bar chart), **Sort by last viewed** (clock)—select an option or click again to cycle asc/desc; (2) **Rating filter**—a horizontal row of five drumstick icons (1–5) for multi-select. The funnel button appears active when any of the three sorts is active or any rating is selected. Dropdown closes on outside click. |

**Direction cycling**: For Date, Progress, and Last viewed (inside the funnel dropdown), when that mode is already active, clicking it again only toggles `sortDirection` between `'asc'` and `'desc'`.

### 2.2 Props

| Prop               | Type       | Description |
|--------------------|------------|-------------|
| `sortBy`           | `string`   | Current sort mode: `'shuffle'` \| `'chronological'` \| `'progress'` \| `'lastViewed'`. |
| `setSortBy`        | `function` | Setter for sort mode. |
| `sortDirection`    | `string`   | `'asc'` \| `'desc'`. Used for chronological, progress, lastViewed. |
| `setSortDirection` | `function` | Setter for direction. |
| `selectedRatings`  | `number[]` | Array of selected rating values (1–5). Empty = no rating filter. |
| `onToggleRating`   | `function` | `(rating: number) => void`. Toggle that rating in/out of `selectedRatings`. |
| `isLight`          | `boolean`  | Optional, default `true`. When `true`, bar uses light theme (white/gray buttons, black borders). When `false`, uses dark theme (white-on-dark) for Unsorted/folder context. |
| `className`        | `string`   | Optional. Applied to the root flex container. |

### 2.3 Styling and UX Details

- **Buttons**: Rounded, border-2, padding; active = filled (black in light theme, white in dark); inactive = translucent with hover darkening.
- **Funnel dropdown**: Opens below the funnel button; left-aligned. Contains (1) three sort rows (Date, Progress, Last viewed), each with icon + label; active row shows direction arrow (↑ asc, ↓ desc); clicking a row selects that sort (desc) or cycles direction if already selected. (2) **Rating filter** section with a label and a horizontal row of five drumstick buttons (1–5); multi-select toggles; selected state = full opacity + scale. Dropdown uses same light/dark styling; closes on outside mousedown.
- ~~**Drumstick strip**~~: Rating filter is now inside the funnel dropdown as a horizontal row (see above).

## 3. Folder Prism (Colored Segment Bar)

The **folder prism** is implemented inside `VideosPage.jsx`, not in `VideoSortFilters.jsx`. It occupies the middle and right part of the sticky toolbar row (flex-1, min-w-0). It shows segments for **All**, **Unsorted**, and the **16 folder colors** from `FOLDER_COLORS` (`src/utils/folderColors.js`). Clicking a segment sets the selected folder and filters the video grid (and updates header/folder context).

### 3.1 Two Prism Modes & Context Menu (right-click)

**Right-click on the prism** opens a contextual menu with the following options:

1. **Prism Display Mode Toggle**: Switches between:
   - **Populated-only (default)**  
     - Only segments with **at least one item** are shown: All (always), Unsorted (if count ≥ 1), and each color that has count ≥ 1.  
     - Segments are **equal width** (flex-1), so 2 segments or 7 segments are equally spaced in the allotted space.  
     - Item counts are shown per segment.  
     - Default when entering the Videos page: `prismOnlyPopulated === true`.
   - **All segments**  
     - All 18 segments are shown: All, Unsorted, and all 16 colors.  
     - Each segment is flex-1 with min/max width constraints; colors with 0 items still appear (count hidden when 0).

2. **Rename Folder**: Opens the `EditPlaylistModal` specialized for the segment you right-clicked on.
   - Right-clicking a colored folder allows renaming that specific folder for the current playlist.
   - Right-clicking the "All" or "Unsorted" segments allows renaming the current main playlist itself.

### 3.2 Segment Types and Appearance

- **All** (`selectedFolder === null`): White background, black text; shows total count (videos + assigned orbs + assigned banners).
- **Unsorted** (`selectedFolder === 'unsorted'`): Black background, white text; shows count of videos with no folder assignment.
- **Color segments**: Background from `FOLDER_COLORS[].hex`; text white with drop-shadow; shows count when visible (in “all segments” mode, count only shown when &gt; 0).

Selected segment is emphasized with a ring (inset ring-2); All uses `after:ring-black/10`, Unsorted `after:ring-white/30`, colors `after:ring-white/50`.

### 3.3 Data and State (VideosPage)

- **Folder selection**: `selectedFolder`, `setSelectedFolder` from `folderStore` (null = All, `'unsorted'`, or a color id).
- **Counts**:  
  - `folderCounts`: per-color counts from `videoFolderAssignments`.  
  - `allCount`: total items (playlist items + orbs + banners for current playlist).  
  - `unsortedCount`: videos in current playlist with no folder assignment.
- **Populated-only segments**: `prismPopulatedSegments` is a `useMemo`: All + Unsorted (if unsortedCount ≥ 1) + each color with count ≥ 1, in order. Used when `prismOnlyPopulated` is true.
- **Prism mode**: `prismOnlyPopulated` (useState, default true); toggled via the **right-click context menu** on the prism.

Pagination and scroll position are reset when folder, sort, or rating filters change (including when switching prism mode if it changes which folder is conceptually “focused”; folder change itself triggers reset).

---

## 4. Sort and Filter Logic (VideosPage)

Sort and rating filtering are applied in `VideosPage` after folder filtering:

- **Rating filter**: If `selectedRatings.length > 0`, the visible list is filtered to items whose `drumstick_rating` is in `selectedRatings`. Orbs and banner presets are kept regardless.
- **Sort**:  
  - `shuffle`: Order by shuffle state (stable order from `shuffleStates[activePlaylistId]`).  
  - `chronological`: Sort by `published_at` or `added_at`; direction from `sortDirection`.  
  - `progress`: Sort by progress percentage (from `videoProgress`); optional filters “hide unwatched” and “show only completed” apply here; direction from `sortDirection`.  
  - `lastViewed`: Sort by `last_updated` from progress data; direction from `sortDirection`.

Progress and last-viewed data come from `getAllVideoProgress` / `getWatchedVideoIds` (and are refreshed on an interval and when the current video index changes).

## 6. Cross-References

- **Videos page and sticky bar**: `ui-pages.md` §4.1.2 (Videos Page, Sticky Toolbar).
- **Drumstick rating system**: `drumstick-rating-system.md` (schema, API, card integration; toolbar filter described there briefly).
- **Folder system and playlists**: `playlist&tab.md` (folders, assignments, tabs).
- **State**: `state-management.md` (`folderStore`, `layoutStore`, `paginationStore`, `shuffleStore`).
- **Database / API**: `database-schema.md`, `api-bridge.md` (folder assignments, progress, ratings).

---

## 7. Summary

- **VideoSortFilters**: A unified toolbar cluster containing:
  - **Home** (default order)
  - **Funnel** (dropdown): sort options (Date, Progress, Last viewed; select or cycle asc/desc) and horizontal **Rating filter** row (1–5 drumsticks).
  - **Plus / Actions** (dropdown): Consolidated Add (uploader), Refresh (subscriptions), and Bulk tag functionalities.
  - **Pagination**: Left and Right chevron buttons flanking the current page number.
- **Styling**: The buttons employ a floating `ICON_WHITE_OUTLINE` style (white fill with solid black drop-shadow) without boxy backgrounds. The sticky toolbar backdrop in `VideosPage` utilizes a solid light blue (`#cde5fa`) native app theme color completely replacing the prior transparency/backdrop-blur scroll effect.
- **Folder prism**: Colored segment bar (All, Unsorted, 16 colors) in the same row. **Right-click on the prism** opens a context menu that contains options to rename the right-clicked segment (or playlist) and to toggle between populated-only (only segments with ≥1 item, equal width) and all segments display modes. Tooltip on the prism confirms it has a context menu.
- State for sort, direction, ratings, pagination, and prism mode lives in `VideosPage`; folder selection in `folderStore`. Sorting and rating filtering are applied in `VideosPage` after folder filtering; pagination resets when any of these change.

## 8. Change log

- **VideoSortFilters consolidation**: Calendar (sort by date), Bar chart (sort by progress), and Clock (sort by last viewed) were consolidated into a single **Funnel** icon button; click opens a dropdown with those three sort options (each select or cycle asc/desc). **Drumstick** rating filter was moved into the same funnel dropdown as a horizontal row (1–5). 
- **Action Button Consolidation**: Add Videos, Subscriptions, and Bulk Tag tools were wrapped into a single **Plus** button dropdown within `VideoSortFilters` mirroring the Funnel structure.
- **Pagination Addition**: Simple `ChevronLeft` and `ChevronRight` page navigation buttons and a page number indicator were appended immediately following the Plus dropdown natively inside `VideoSortFilters`, accepting `currentPage` and `totalPages` props.
- **Aesthetic Refinements**: `VideoSortFilters` buttons alongside the Go Back and Close buttons stripped out backdrop boundaries, strictly employing white icons cleanly outlined with a thick black drop-shadow (`ICON_WHITE_OUTLINE`).
- **Sticky toolbar backdrop**: The shifting transparency and `backdrop-blur` UI effect on scrolling was flattened completely into a static solid light blue backdrop color (`#cde5fa`) matching the native app theme uniformly.
- **Folder prism**: The separate arrow button to the right of the prism was removed. **Right-click** anywhere on the prism opens a context menu. We added the options to rename folders/playlists and toggle between populated-only (only segments with ≥1 item, equal width) and all segments. Tooltip on the prism reflects that a context menu is available.
- **Sticky toolbar setup**: Container uses `overflow-visible` so the funnel and actions dropdowns are not clipped; dropdowns use `z-50`.
